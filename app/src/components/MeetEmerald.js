          Emerald was founded in 2015 with the mission of helping homeowners and
          communities maintain safe, thriving, and enjoyable outdoor spaces.
          Emerald was created when two former engineers in Edmonton saw an
          opportunity to provide homeowners with convenient, reliable yard care
          and a better customer experience. Our focus is on building lasting
          relationships by delivering consistently high-quality work through a
          professional and courteous customer service team. Our user-friendly
          digital system makes it even easier for clients to seamlessly manage
          their services.
